# Artificial Intelligence Disrupting the E-Commerce Industry

E-commerce itself is disruptive innovation. Traditional businesses, also known as brick and mortar, had to reevaluate their operations and strategies to be able to keep up. However, many online businesses continue to level up the competition, using various new technologies to gain and maintain consumers (Icicle Technologies, 2020). 

One of these technologies is Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, a sub-category of this is Machine Learning, which is being used in many huge e-commerce businesses (Icicle Technologies, 2020). Hao (2018) defines machine learning as an algorithm that identifies a pattern from the data it collects. This is extremely useful for businesses to predict and satisfy customer wants and needs and cut losses to earn more profit.

Due to AI’s predictive ability, online vendors can apply this algorithm in a wide range of business operations. The following is a list of well-known applications of AI that you probably have noticed by now if you have online shopped.

### Image Searching

When a buyer doesn’t know how to search for the item they want, but they have an image of it saved in their device, the AI can find it for them. Armed with “intelligent image searching technology,” the system can identify the items present in the picture and bring up a list of similar-looking products (Icicle Technologies, 2020; Kosmayer, 2020).

### Dynamic Pricing

This strategy uses data to alter pricing on products in real-time. By observing the competitions’ pricing and sales data, the AI ensures that the price would encourage a transaction and, the business would still profit greatly (Icicle Technology, 2020).

### Virtual Assistants and Chatbots

This technology aids in an online shopper’s experience by being able to answer common questions and are available 24/7. They also collect and track customer data to make the experience more personalized and help the shopper find what they need (Kosmayer, 2020; Meyster, 2020).

### Inventory Management

Businesses can predict and keep track of inventory with AI. Data concerning market demand is used to acquire the right amount of goods for present and future operations. (Kosmayer, 2020).

### Predicting Customer Behavior

The AI collects psychographic and demographic data to predict trends. With this, businesses can improve marketing tactics to maximize profits. (Icicle Technology, 2020). 

According to Aljukjadar (2018), AI disrupts the “current e-commerce model.” In the past, businesses would be the ones to coax demand but, now what the consumers want, they get. Notice that the examples mentioned above focus on what the market wants and catering to that. Aljukjadar goes on to claim that soon, with the help of AI, customers would dictate their orders and, sellers would have to consider it depending on various details. As he wrote, “AI will transform online buying to online negotiating.”
