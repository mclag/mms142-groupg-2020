Despite the ubiquitous impact of technology on all aspects of society today, education appears to have been mostly unchanged. The manner in which students are taught remain mostly the same since ancient times - a teacher stands in front while students sit in rows and listen. Some might find this to be their ideal learning environment, but most others struggle and are left behind in a system that is still largely standardized (Boyce, 2019).

According to Jessica (2019), educational institutions around the world are facing three critical challenges: (1) providing quality education, (2) ensuring education is accessible, and (3) reducing the cost of delivery to make education affordable.

## AI in Education

A number of EdTech solutions appear every day, but perhaps the one with the most potential to impact the education sector is artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). AI promises to address the problems present within the traditional practices of education, making learning more accessible and approachable to students of all abilities (Advani, 2019). As it did with other aspects of our life, AI can transform how education is administered and delivered. Below are some examples on how artificial intelligence is being applied to education today:

#### Personalized Learning

Learning under a standardized curriculum is hard given that not all students learn the same way. Each one has their own special needs that need to be met. However, it is almost impossible for an educator to address  all of them effectively in their teaching. This is where artificial intelligence can help. AI and ML algorithms can understand the individual needs of the students and provide the appropriate learning tools (Agnihotri, 2019).

#### Universal Access of Education

AI can help make education accessible to students who speak different languages or who have hearing and visual impairments. As an example, PowerPoint has a free plug-in called Presentation Translator which provides subtitles when a teacher is talking in real-time (Marr, 2018).

#### Automating Administrative Tasks

Educators spend a significant amount of time grading assignments and exams every week. AI can help lessen this burden as it is close to being able to assess written responses and essay-type exams. It could reduce the reliance of educational institutions on multiple-choice exams, which machines can already grade.

In addition, AI can provide teachers instant feedback regarding their students' learning, and recommend steps to help them progress in their journey. This and the simplification of administrative tasks allow educators more time to spend with each learner (Marr, 2018).

#### Resolving Questions and Queries

It is quite difficult for educators to answer each individual question of every student when they have over 30 students to handle in each class. Through the use of virtual assistants (VAs), such as Amazon's Alexa which has been trialed in Hillbrook School in California, students are given the opportunity to look up the answers for themselves, saving the teacher's time by avoiding repetitive questions. The analytics for the questions asked can help teachers identify weaknesses in learning and adjust their teaching accordingly (Jessica, 2018).

## Challenges of AI in Education

AI and ML still face several challenges and limitations that need to be addressed before they can truly be implemented in the field of education (Jessica, 2018):

Inadequate infrastructure and funds: Implementing AI technologies at scale is expensive, and not all institutions have access to these funds.

Fear and resistance to change: Changing the thoughts of students and teachers and having them adopt newer technologies that can aid in education is not an easy task. Some educators fear being replaced and losing their jobs in the process as well.

Adoption at scale: The integration of AI requires the support of multiple stakeholders such as parents, students, teachers, administrators, and policymakers, which is difficult to achieve right away. 

Data privacy and cybersecurity: This is one of the biggest risks of the implementation of AI in education as much personal data is needed for success.

Subject limitations: AI is not always relevant or effective in all subjects. For example, personalized learning and automated assessment are unlikely to work in practical subjects with strong subjectiveness in assessment like drama, art and physical education.

## Conclusion

As we have seen, there are a number ways that AI can aid in addressing the challenges of traditional education on either the side of the learner or the educator. If we would be able to overcome the challenges and find an accessible and affordable way of implementing technology into the curriculum, then we would be able to tap into the potential of AI in education.
