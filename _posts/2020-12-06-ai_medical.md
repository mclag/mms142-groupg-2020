Artificial Intelligence in the medical and health field is referring to the utilization of AI technology in the treatment and diagnosis of patients. Using Artificial Intelligence in the Medical field does not necessarily mean that the computer is doing the diagnosis and process. Rather, it is about utilizing artificial intelligence to assist healthcare professionals in the analysis, interpretation, and comprehension of medical data.

A goal of utilizing AI in the medical field is the automation of tasks that could be automated such as (1) gathering data through tests, (2) processing and analyzing basic results, (3) patient monitoring, etc., and thus maximizing human resource by allowing professionals to spend time on duties that couldnâ€™t be automated.

Artificial Intelligence in the medical field is not about over-automating the field, but rather balance between the effective use of technology and human prowess in the medical profession.

Artificial Intelligence is also applicable in the medical and health field through usage of decision support systems to help explain clinical manifestation of disease. Clinical Decision Support systems are software tools that assist health professionals in decision making, analyzing past, current, and trending patient data to identify or suggest concerns or improvements to patients. Such systems also help in reducing medical errors.
