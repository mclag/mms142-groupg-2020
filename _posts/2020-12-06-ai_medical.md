Artificial Intelligence in the medical and health field is referring to the utilization of AI technology in the treatment and diagnosis of patients. Using Artificial Intelligence in the Medical field does not necessarily mean that the computer is doing the diagnosis and process. Rather, it is about utilizing artificial intelligence to assist healthcare professionals in the analysis, interpretation, and comprehension of medical data.

A goal of utilizing AI in the medical field is the automation of tasks that could be automated such as (1) gathering data through tests, (2) processing and analyzing basic results, (3) patient monitoring, etc., and thus maximizing human resource by allowing professionals to spend time on duties that couldn’t be automated.

Artificial Intelligence in the medical field is not about over-automating the field, but rather balance between the effective use of technology and human prowess in the medical profession. 

The following are examples of application of Artificial Intelligence in the medical field.

### AI Assisted Surgery

As technical skills vary from surgeon to surgeon, Artificial Intelligence assisted surgery aims to help reduce variations in procedures. AI in surgery enables machine to understand, act upon, and learn techniques that allow them to perform surgical functions. 



### Clinical Decision Support Systems

Artificial Intelligence is also applicable in the medical and health field through usage of decision support systems to help explain clinical manifestation of disease. Clinical Decision Support systems are software tools that assist health professionals in decision making, analyzing past, current, and trending patient data to identify or suggest concerns or improvements to patients. Such systems also help in reducing medical errors. 

[Buoy Health](https://www.buoyhealth.com/#solutions) is an AI-based symptom and cure checker wherein you chat with an AI-ran bot that guides you through the appropriate care based on symptoms and diagnosis. 


### Therapy

Programs built upon years of research and clinical trials are readily available for consumers to use for therapy and personal counseling. Programs such as the AI Therapy guides you through a number of lessons carefully designed to help effectively target anxiety. According to their website, “All pages include pre-recorded sound files from Ross and Fjola that explain the key concepts behind CBT and the other treatment strategies.” More info can be found [HERE](https://www.ai-therapy.com/overcome-social-anxiety/how-it-works)


### Diagnosis

Certain applications assist professionals in diagnosis of lab and test results. Applications like [PATH AI](https://www.pathai.com/) aims to reduce error in cancer diagnosis and develop methods for individual treatments.

[FREENOME](https://www.freenome.com/) aims for early cancer detection with the help of Artificial Intelligence in screenings, diagnostic tests and blood samples.
