Artificial Intelligence is the next big thing in the mobile phone industry. It enhances mobile phone hardware and software to create better performance and user experience.

The mobile phone industry has been one of the industries where AI has been successfully used for over the years now. Smartphones have become a necessity for everyone and it now becomes a part of people’s lives. In order to provide better user experience, every year mobile phone manufacturer has been doing a lot of improvement when it comes to the quality of the images and videos captured by the phone camera, design, performance, and other features of their flagship mobile phones. Before smartphone only uses cloud-based and Internet-dependent AI but right now mobile phone manufacturer uses both cloud-based AI along with built-in AI (Sreejith, 2019). Mobile phone manufacturers like Samsung, Apple, Oppo, Huawei, and others are utilizing as well as leveraging Artificial Intelligence into the development of their smartphone models (Anurag, 2020).

This article will tackle how AI transforms the mobile phone industry. Below are examples of the usage of AI and how it enables mobile technology to perform better and do complex tasks.

## Three Things AI can do in Mobile Phone Industry 

#### 1.	Speech Recognition and Real Time Language Translation

Speech recognition is the process that enables a computer to recognize and respond to spoken words and then converting them into a format that the machine understands. The machine may then convert it into another form of data depending on the end-goal (AISmartz, 2019). According to Cheyenne Noelle's article, speech recognition has been existing since the 1950s but it was only recognized during the 1990s. It was the Apple company that pioneered in integrating speech recognition in their mobile phone device which is popularly known as Siri an AI-powered digital assistant. Soon after Siri was launched, companies such as Microsoft followed by launching Cortana, Amazon with Alexa, birthing an entire industry marked by voice command (Noelle, 2019). As the market grows, different mobile phone companies integrated AI assistants on their mobile phones. The AI assistant can do call routing, speech-to-text processing, voice dialing, and voice search. It also allows an individual to do a voice command on the device and let it do a specific task. The AI applications aim to replace human secretaries and personal assistants that performed tasks such as reading text and taking dictation, finding phone numbers and placing calls, emailing schedules and meeting reminders, and others (Chourasia, 2020). 

With the increasing popularity of AI assistant, in its Digital Assistant and Voice AI-Capable Device Forecast for 2016 to 2021, research and consulting firm Ovum claims, by 2021, the native digital assistant base globally is set to exceed 7.5 billion active devices. By 2021, around 47.6% of voice AI-capable devices are expected to be used in Asia and Oceania. Some of the popular AI assistant in the markets are Google Assistant with a 23.3 percent market share, Samsung’s Bixby has 14.5 percent market share, Apple’s Siri has 13.1 percent, Amazon’s Alexa has a 3.9 percent, and Microsoft’s Cortana with 2.3 percent of market share (Chourasia, 2020). As people get busier and much more focused on demanding task which may take long hours to finish, they wanted to have someone to rely on to do some personal task that will let them save time. With that, AI assistant could be the best option as it is cheaper and efficient rather than hiring someone.

Aside from speech recognition, another thing that AI can do is that it is capable of translating one language into different languages. With a built-in AI translator on a smartphone or an application, language translation can be done in real-time. In 1997 only text where being translated and the company that pioneered online translation is AltaVista with their website called Babel Fish. According to Glenn Le Santo, AI made it possible to translate spoken language. He said that with the use of AI a translation engine listens to words being spoken, it will attempt to identify the language it hears and what’s being said. Waveforms of sound are analyzed to identify which parts seem to correspond to translations as it builds. The engine then attempts to translate what it thinks it hears into what it believes to be normal speech in the destination language (Le Santo, 2018). For people who just want to have a quick way to learn different languages or want to easily communicate with foreign people having this language translator would really help them to build more connection.

#### 2. Cybersecurity 
People use the internet every day using their mobile phones. Every time they visit their social media accounts, banking applications, e-commerce sites all their personal information and bank details such as credit cards had been logged in all those sites. With that, there is risk wherein data breach can happen. In order to not compromise user information, mobile phone manufacturers used AI to protect users from cyber-attack. AI-enhanced cybersecurity using biometrics, finger prints, hands- free gesture, facial unlock system, and multifactor authentication on mobile devices. AI-based algorithms can find malware and threats and alert users' account in real-time. It can also add a level of augmentation to biometric authentication which makes it impossible for a hacker to hack the system and device (Anurag, 2020).

#### 3. AI  Phone Cameras 
A more advanced camera system is one of the selling points of a smartphone. People nowadays don’t just buy them for communication purposes or to browse the internet but instead, people use them to take photos and videos to create content which they can upload on their social media accounts. People demand more improved hardware and software to be able to get the highest quality photos and videos. Every year, mobile phone manufacturer is on the competition and they are challenged by the user to bring in the best camera technology on their flagship smartphone. With the help of AI, phone cameras are getting better than DSLR cameras. 

Computational photography is usually the core of an AI-powered camera (Kanchwala, 2019). Computational photography refers to digital image capture and processing techniques that use digital computation instead of optical processes (Wikipedia, 2020). One of the reason why smartphone cameras are getting better than DSLR cameras is that it has all access to all the latest computational photography tools because of the continuous updates on its operating system. Also with AI in phone cameras, scene recognition, edge detection in portraits, face recognition, enhancing color profiles, smoothing skin and other image processing options can be done easily (Gogoi,2019).
