Public relations (PR) is said to be the discipline of managing reputations. It is involved in handling the flow of information between an individual or an organization and the public to control public perception. From its inception in the 1890s, the field has been focused in the promotional practice of making a person, brand, or company appeal to, and maintain a good image to the public. Other industries such as marketing and advertising is also a part of doing good PR work. Through the years, it has adapted to technologies to keep up with the times and clients’ needs.
Artificial intelligence (AI) on the other hand are humanoid technologies that allows machines to exhibit human-like understanding and functions such as comprehending, learning, and problem-solving. Computer science through AI has managed to develop machines smart enough to do tasks that normally require human intellect. A cross-disciplinary approach involving mathematics, computer science, linguistics, psychology, and more, is employed in programming AI machines. The use of AI goes as far as the imagination can go, and it is now used in multiple industries, public relations included.

# AI application in PR
Public relations has been transformed by the Internet and electronic communications (Gregory, 2004). The digital age demands users to constantly acquire new digital skills because of the ever growing advancements in the way that individuals communicate and interact. In a 2012 study, it was found that PR and communications practitioners struggle with the impact of new media and the Internet in their practice (Robson & James, 2012 as cited in Panda et al., 2019). This was mostly apparent with more senior publicists who need to adapt to emerging trends and technologies. This is not to say however that PR is not adjusting to how people consume information now. In fact, social media platforms are now greatly utilized by PR agencies to send out their message. And while there is a gap in social media capabilities, agencies have managed to be completely onboard the new game. In fact, AI has already been playing various roles in public relations. 

Before we discuss what are the different AI applications in PR, it must first be clarified that while on the surface it seems that AI in public relations centralizes in task automation, that is not the case, at least for the future. Right now AI tackles menial and repetitive tasks to free up practitioners’ time to allow them to pursue more productive tasks. To Galloway and Swiatek (2018), AI will dramatically change the landscape of PR practice, not merely selected contours of it.

At present, AI streamlines functions, analyzes massive data, and develops personas without human error, thus providing accuracy. It also reduces costs and delivers output at the fraction of the time it would take if a person did it. 

As mentioned earlier, AI takes on the job of doing mundane and repetitive tasks. PR professionals typically spend time on scheduling, preparing meeting notes, creating and meeting deadlines, and following up with clients as well as influencers (Panda et al., 2019). This involves answering bulks of emails, checking the calendar and, formulating reports. On top of that they have to update media lists, and schedule updates of media rounds and numbers. You can imagine how much time it would take to routinely do all of this. Practitioners will no longer have to do this as AI could do this for them. In fact, there is now an emerging technology practice called Robotic Process Automation (RPA). It is an AI that allows businesses to automate rule-based processes. (The Past, Present, and Future of Artificial Intelligence in PR, 2019)

AI can also take the burden of sifting through massive data from a variety of sources like social media, website traffic, and other digital touchpoints. With the insights generated from the data, PR professionals can make informed and active decisions (Panda et al., 2019). Data crunching, data updating, follow-ups and, drafting detailed client needs and progress will be a breeze.

We all probably have experienced social media algorithms working behind the scenes to tailor our browsing experience to our browsing behavior. This is another work of AI. These days, AI is being used to develop buyer personas and create engaging content for these buyers. With the help of AI, agencies can know the choices, buying patterns, habits, influences, pain points, and point of failures of online users. Based on these, companies can create and deliver targeted messages (Panda et al., 2019). 

Nowadays, AI is used in sentiment analysis, which utilizes natural language processing to differentiate vocabulary use, tone, and language context (The Past, Present, and Future of Artificial Intelligence in PR, 2019). This technology can provide real-time insight to PR practitioners in crisis management. 

These AI functions are only foreseen to be smarter and more efficient in time. Stephen Waddington, chief engagement officer at global PR firm Ketchum, said that in five years’ time, AI is likely to have a stronger grip on PR functions. AI is seen to be involved in content creation, automation of tasks, crisis management, and agency-client relationship management. 

# Is AI in public relations disruptive?

In the study of Panda et al. (2019), 31 PR professionals were interviewed regarding the application of AI in public relations. The participants had a mixed response when asked if AI has the potential to be a strategic disruption in the PR industry. Most of the professionals felt that AI is in its nascent phase of development and application in the PR industry, thus it is still too early to comment on it as a strategic disruption. However, they see the prospect of a smaller agency powered with AI disrupting major agencies and networks. They concluded that AI has the potential to be a strategic disruption in the near future.

# Possible issues of AI in PR 
Implementation concerns are one of the most salient points when talking about applying AI-driven systems in public relations. An AI system will definitely have a business and financial impact. For one, costs will be high and not every PR agency will be able to afford it.

There is also something called **“AI Anxiety”**, referring to the *“fear of the stability and capabilities of AI”* (Johnson & Verdicchio 2017 as cited in Galloway & Swiatek, 2018). While it is mostly fear of robotization and potential job losses, it also raises ethical issues of robots “taking control” of humans, and the question of do we need to teach robots ethical behavior.
Galloway and Swiatek (2018) suggests that
> “Such anxieties need calming; the more realistic scenario is that “automation will eliminate very few occupations entirely in the next decade” and, instead, will “affect portions of almost all jobs to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the type of work they entail”.

A 2018 Chartered Institute of Public Relations report suggests that
> “public relations practitioners are unlikely to interact with robots or even to be replaced by them. Only a minority of public relations tasks are susceptible to automation”.

It also found that 59 per cent of public relations skills are “predominantly not candidates for AI”. (Valin, 2018 as cited in Galloway & Swiatek, 2018).

There is a debate as to whether AI can replace human creativity or not. Ristic (2017 as cited in Galloway & Swiatek, 2018) argues that PR requires human creativity, which machines at the moment cannot supersede. Creativity such as ensuring tone of voice in written communication or executing a creative stunt. He says, “a bot can’t lay claim to emotional intelligence, a cornerstone of all PR work”.

The idea that “creativity is a uniquely human endeavor that cannot be deconstructed and replicated by machines” is contended by Amos (2016) saying that
> “Computational creativity is one of the most vibrant areas of AI research, and algorithms have been developed to independently compose music, write poetry and develop new recipes.”

Mcstay (2018) supports this stating that
> “Media technologies are able to interpret feelings, emotions, moods, attention and intention in private and public places…this equates to a technological form of empathy.”

Nonetheless, AI is here and it will not only stay, but it will have a role in augmenting human communications. In adapting to AI-driven systems, agencies should familiarize themselves with basic AI concepts as well as its current developments. They should also be aware of the available capacities of AI on existing PR services and processes. An assessment of their current technological and business process is needed. Training and giving the necessary skills to existing employees should also be given focus. PR agencies should already have a digital backbone as base for adapting to AI systems, consequentially, they should organize their existing data as any current data can be used in training the AI system. This also implies the need for flexibility in hardware and software, and ensuring security and privacy. What tasks are to be automated should also be clear beforehand. ***Most importantly, the agency should maintain a balance between the AI systems’ operational efficiency and the creative potential of its human work force.*** (Marvin, 2018 as cited in Panda et al., 2019).

Agencies and clients should watch out for these issues when adapting to AI systems if they want to integrate it to their business successfully.
