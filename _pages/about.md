<p>Technology had made people lives easier and better. Through technological advancement a lot of things have been made possible like for example communicating with other people even if they are miles away by using electronic technologies such as mobile phone, laptop or computer and with the help of internet connectivity. But as the market grows, businesses continuously searching for ways to make things differently and become efficient in their own industry. This is the reason why many businesses become a trailblazer as they tried to disrupt different business model by employing disruptive technologies.</p>

<p>Disruptive technology is an innovation that significantly alters the way that consumers, industries, or businesses operate. A disruptive technology sweeps away the systems or habits it replaces because it has attributes that are recognizably superior (Smith, 2020). According to Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, the following lead to successful disruptive technology:
-	Enabling Technology: An innovation or invention that makes a product affordable and accessible to a wider population.
-Innovative Business Model: A business model that targets new consumers that didn’t buy products in an existing market, or low-end consumers (the least profitable customers).
-	Coherent Value Network: A network in which suppliers, distributors and customers are better off when the disruptive technology prospers (Florida Tech, n.d.).</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the example of disruptive technology that have significantly impacted different industries. AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning, problem-solving, recognizing the nuances of speech, or exhibiting some form of human-like creativity (Frankenfield, 2020; Sciencealert, n.d.). Artificial intelligence is created to perform specific tasks usually done by humans.  According to the article by Jason Bloomberg, of all the technologies that drive digital transformation in the enterprise, artificial intelligence (AI) is said to be the most disruptive of them all (Bloomberg, 2018).  AI can be used to improve quality, speed, functionality, and even drive top-line revenue growth (Sallomi, n.d.). With AI, it increases automation across all industries that it disrupts people’s day-to-day jobs (Bloomberg, 2018).</p>

<p>In this group project we conducted research on how AI disrupt and make useful in the industry like Education, Public Relation, Transportation, E-commerce, Mobile Phone, Health and Medical Field.</p>
