<p>TArtificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning, problem-solving, recognizing the nuances of speech, or exhibiting some form of human-like creativity (Frankenfield, 2020; Sciencealert, n.d.). Artificial intelligence is created to perform specific tasks usually done by humans.  According to the article by Jason Bloomberg, of all the technologies that drive digital transformation in the enterprise, artificial intelligence (AI) is said to be the most disruptive of them all (Bloomberg, 2018).  AI can be used to improve quality, speed, functionality, and even drive top-line revenue growth (Sallomi, n.d.). With AI, it increases automation across all industries that it disrupts peopleâ€™s day-to-day jobs (Bloomberg, 2018).
